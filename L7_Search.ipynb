    "### Dynamic Programming\n",
    "This is alternative algorithm of A-star and just like A-star it is going to find shortest path. This planning technique is not limited to a single start locagion but to any start location. In reality, we need a plan not just for most likely position but we might need other positions as well. Because the world is stocastic, for example, the node where we think it is open might be occupied by the other vehicle, in this case we couldn't take the best route. What Dynamic Programming gives us is plan for every positions.\n",
